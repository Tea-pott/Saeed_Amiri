## Covid Data Exploration with SQL (MS SQL Server)

**Project description:** 
1. Data origin: The data was pulled from [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
2. The data covers a wide range of information from death count to test, vaccination, hospital admissions, financial and medical conditions, GDP, etc of all countries from the beginning of the pandemic so far.
3. Goal of the project - What am I looking for in this data or what questions I am trying to answer: In this project, I did some exploration with some of the columns (attributes) of the dataset, namely daily new_case, death and vaccination counts and organized and filtered to make quantitative observations and get a sense for the data.
4. Gist of what I have found in the data set: 

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
